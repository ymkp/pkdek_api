# pkdek api
yet another pokedex api, powered by [POKEAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

This app fetches pokemon data from POKEAPI, save it on DB, and use it for personal use. The goal here is to make a website that looks like bulbapedia.

## installation
1. clone this repository
2. rename or copy .env.example to .env
3. make sure you have mysql and empty database named pkdek (or the same as in .env)
4. ```npm run start```

## existing app
you can check [pkdek.rutesatu docs](https://pkdek.rutesatu.com/docs) for existing api docs
